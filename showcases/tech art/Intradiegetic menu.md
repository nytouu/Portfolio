# Intradiegetic menu

For the in-game pause menu in DERAYAH, our first idea was a minimal 2D pause menu, we ended up scrapping this idea as it was too simple, not original and limited our creativity to make something that would satisfy the team. For that reason I proposed an idea : a 3D intradiegetic menu, with cloud-like buttons and text formed by particles of sand. 

We kept that idea as it was original and it also made so that the first person view would not be interrupted, which was nice since that is also the case for the puzzles.

The first step for creating the menu was sketching that idea, I did a few sketches on GIMP to show the menu in its different stages and how it should animate.

After confirming what would end up in the final menu, I started actually creating the VFX in Unity using the VFX Graph. The goal was to create first the visual aspect of the VFX and then make it interactible in game.
