## I'm Jos√©-Daniel Capitaine
I'm a Game programmer & Tech Artist.

I have been programming ever since early high school in 2018 and I started programming games in 2020, first as a hobby and then making it my main focus by entering a Game Design school in 2022. I've dabbled with a lot of different languages and frameworks :
- Unity
- Unreal Engine
- Godot
- Bevy
- Pygame
- Phaser

I became interested in **Tech Art** during my time as a student, mainly creating visual effects in **Unity** and dabbling with Unreal and Godot as well. Indeed, the creative process behind tech art is very fulfilling and is something that I felt lacked in gameplay/3C programming.

My experience during school, and through different game jams made me aware of how a game production works, I often have to communicate with other programmers, 2D & 3D artists as well as Game Designers and Level Designers.
